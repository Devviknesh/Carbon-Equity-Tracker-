Database Design for Carbon Equity Tracker  

The Carbon Equity Tracker uses three databases to organize information effectively. Each database contains tables designed for specific purposes.  
This project uses 3 different databases.
1. Database: cet_login  
   Purpose: Manages user authentication by securely storing login credentials.  
   Table:  
   - Logincred  
     - username: A unique name for each user (Primary Key).  
     - password: The userâ€™s password, stored securely.  

2. Database: cet_user  
   Purpose: Stores individual user data, including daily activities and carbon footprint.  
   Table:  
   - User_data  
     - user_id: A unique identifier for each user (Primary Key).  
     - daily_commute: Distance traveled daily by the user (in kilometers).  
     - waste_generated: Amount of waste generated daily (in kg).  
     - country: The user's country (for region-specific emissions).  
     - total_emissions: The calculated carbon footprint for the user.  

3. Database: cet_industry  
   Purpose: Stores data for industries to calculate their emissions.  
   Table:  
   - Industry_data  
     - industry_id: A unique identifier for each industry (Primary Key).  
     - energy_consumed: Total energy used by the industry (in kilowatt-hours).  
     - materials_used: Amount of raw materials consumed (in tons).  
     - total_emissions: The calculated carbon footprint for the industry.  

Key Features of the Design:  
- Logical separation of data into different databases for better management.  
- Relationships between tables are secured using foreign keys, e.g., linking user_id in cet_user with username in cet_login.  
- Indexes are implemented to improve the performance of frequently used queries.  

This design ensures efficient, secure, and user-friendly data handling.
